\section{Scope}

The objective of this penetration test is to evaluate the security posture of a single system within the client's environment. The assessment is limited to the following boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Target System:} 10.129.243.43
	\item \textbf{Services and Applications in Scope:} All services and applications hosted on the client system
	\item \textbf{Testing Type:} \gls{blackboxtest}
	\item \textbf{Testing Limitations:} No social engineering, no denial-of-service testing, and no lateral movement to other hosts
\end{itemize}

The goal is to identify vulnerabilities that could potentially allow unauthorized access, data leakage, or compromise of system integrity.  

All findings, recommendations, and risk ratings are based solely on the assessed system and its configurations at the time of testing.
